Additional to visually calculating the terrestrial days within a Martian year, a function and a for-loop were created to calculate the number of terrestrial days based on the data within the table.

# Overall Results of Martian Analysis

1) The month of 3 with a temp of -83.3073 is the coldest Martian month 
 and the month of 8 with a temp of -68.3830 is the hottest Martian month.

2) The month of 6 with an average pressure of 745.0544 is the lowest pressure Martian month 
 and the month of 9 with an average pressure of 913.3060 is the highest pressure Martian month.

3) By plotting minimum temp vs earth days and calculating the number of days 
 between two minimum temp days, a Martian year is calculated as 727 days.
 
4) According to calculations from the data within the table,
there are 686.4602 terrestrial days in a Martian year
with a standard deviation of 0.5978
based on a total of 352 data points of a possible 360.
